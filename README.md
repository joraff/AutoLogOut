Retired app written in ObjC that was used in large computer labs to ensure timely reclaimation of idle/abandoned Mac computers.

The apps is launched in the background during a user session. When idle conditions are triggered, visual and audible alerts are given to the user warning of an upcoming forced logout. The user can dismiss the alerts to reset the idle timer. If the alerts are not acknowledged or dismissed, the app will kill all user session apps to avoid unsaved changes from preventing an ordinary idle logout.
